## üìå Introduction

This project analyzes the **Superstore Sales Dataset**, a popular retail dataset containing detailed transactional records of customer orders. The dataset covers order details, shipping information, product categories, customer segments, and financial metrics such as sales, discount, and profit.

The goal of this analysis is to extract insights into:

* Sales performance
* Discount impact on profitability
* Regional and customer segmentation trends
* Shipping and delivery efficiency

Using **Excel** for data transformation, visualization, and KPI dashboards, this project simulates a real-world retail analytics workflow and generates actionable business recommendations.

2. **Performance by Metrics**

   * Distribution of **quantity, customers, sales, profit, and discounts** across the same dimensions.

3. **Discount & Profitability**

   * Compare sales with vs. without discounts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Transformation

Data was prepared using **Power Query in Excel**.

### Transformation Steps

| Step | Description                                                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Promoted headers from first row                                 |
| 2    | Assigned correct data types (text, date, number)                |
| 3    | Recalculated Discount as `Discount √ó Sales`                     |
| 4    | Reorganized and renamed columns                                 |
| 5    | Created `Delivery Days` = Ship Date ‚Äì Order Date                |
| 6    | Added `"Discount Availability"` column (Discount / No Discount) |

### Power Query Script (M Code)

    #"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Changed Type1",{{"Discountt", "Discount"}}), 
    #"Added Custom1" = Table.AddColumn(#"Renamed Columns", "Delivery Date", each [Ship Date]-[Order Date]), 
    #"Changed Type2" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Added Custom1",{{"Delivery Date", type number}}), 
    #"Renamed Columns1" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Changed Type2",{{"Delivery Date", "Delivery Days"}}), 
    #"Added Conditional Column" = Table.AddColumn(#"Renamed Columns1", "Discount Availability", each if [Discount] = 0 then "No Discount" else "Discount")
