## 🛠️ Data Transformation

Data was prepared using **Power Query in Excel**.

### Transformation Steps

| Step | Description                                                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Promoted headers from first row                                 |
| 2    | Assigned correct data types (text, date, number)                |
| 3    | Recalculated Discount as `Discount × Sales`                     |
| 4    | Reorganized and renamed columns                                 |
| 5    | Created `Delivery Days` = Ship Date – Order Date                |
| 6    | Added `"Discount Availability"` column (Discount / No Discount) |
